# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- When doing large multi-step migrations or tasks, always create and maintain a PROGRESS.md file in the repo root to track what's done and what's left. Work in small incremental chunks that produce working code, rather than spending all the time reading and analyzing.
